          The department of <span class="bold">Electronics and Communication Engineering</span> strives to
          produce top-notice engineers with global competence for industry,
          research and academia. The major objective of the department is to
          foster innovation, design and creation of eco-sustainable products and
          solutions to meet the growing technological demands. The department
          serves over 250 undergraduate students with a team of dedicated
          faculty members who are committed towards teaching and research in the
          <span class="bold">areas of signal processing, electronic circuit design, communication
          systems, VLSI, machine learning, internet of things (IoT) and embedded
          systems.</span> The department has fully equipped laboratories with state of
          the art equipment for conducting laboratory courses, research and
          consultancy activities. The collaboration with industries such as
          national instruments, key sight technologies, Texas instruments and
          Pasco has aided the department in providing a good platform for the
          students to learn the concepts experientially and to work on real time
          industrial problems. The department associates with various industries
          to conduct one credit/value added courses for the students to bridge
          the gap between industry and academia, thereby enhancing their
          placement opportunities. The department also conducts national
          conferences every year to provide a platform to gather and disseminate
          the knowledge and results of original research and discussion of
          practical insights. The students are also provided <span class="bold">guidance towards
          higher studies, research and entrepreneurial activities.</span> Holistic
          living classes are conducted to instill the spirit of ethical
          practices, human values and an attitude to serve the society. Students
          are encouraged to participate in the national level technical
          competitions hosted by the industries and other prestigious
          educational institutions and they have their own laurels in the legacy
          to their juniors. Apart from academics, our students also take part
          and organize several activities within the college, which fosters the
          organizational and leadership skills of students. Owing to the current
          pandemic scenario, faculty members and students have taken up various
          online MOOC courses through coursera, edx, udemy etc.., to hone their
          technical skills during the lockdown phase. Several webinars have been
          conducted by inviting resource persons from reputed organizations to
          help the students to keep pace with the trending technological
          advancements.
